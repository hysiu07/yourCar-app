## Description

My car rental application is a comprehensive project built using Next.js technology. Leveraging the Next.js framework, I have created various functionalities that enable users to conveniently browse car rental offers and make reservations.

Key features of the application include:

**API Endpoints**
I implemented API endpoints to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend. These endpoints allow data retrieval for cars, offers, and reservation management.

**Admin Panel**
I developed an admin panel that enables management of car rental offers, reservation browsing, and management. The admin panel provides a simple interface for adding, deleting, and updating data.

**Redux**
I utilized the Redux library to manage the application state, enabling efficient data management and synchronization across different components.

**NextAuth Authentication**
The application utilizes NextAuth authentication mechanism, providing secure login and user registration. This allows users to safely make reservations and manage their accounts.

**Integration with Airtable and Cloudinary**
I utilized Airtable and Cloudinary platforms for storing car data and managing images. Integration with these platforms enables easy data management and efficient image uploading and display.

**Advanced Next.js Features**
The application utilizes advanced Next.js features such as data fetching with getStaticProps and getStaticPaths, ensuring fast and efficient page rendering. This allows users to smoothly browse car rental offers without unnecessary delay.

**Integration with Stripe in Test Mode**
For payment processing, the application integrates with the Stripe platform in test mode. This enables secure and efficient credit card payment processing.

My car rental application is a comprehensive solution that combines various frontend and backend functionalities, providing users with a convenient and secure car rental service.

**User Feedback**
All information goes through Airtable, and changes are dynamic. If something is changed, the reservation status, payments, and the ability to add a car are updated instantly.

**Dynamic Integration with Airtable**
My car rental application relies on dynamic integration with the Airtable platform, allowing immediate reflection of changes in reservation status, payments, and car rental offers. As a result, every change made in the system is immediately visible to users.

The application allows management of various aspects, such as adding new cars to the offer, updating existing offers, and monitoring reservation and payment statuses. All these operations are convenient and intuitive, ensuring smooth usage of the application for both users and administrators.

Thanks to dynamic integration with Airtable, users can easily browse current car rental offers, make reservations, and track their status in real-time. This makes the application not only a convenient tool for car rental but also an effective way to manage vehicle fleets and serve customers.
